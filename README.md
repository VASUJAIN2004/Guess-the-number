# 🎯 Guess the Number - Python Game

A simple command-line game built with Python where the computer randomly selects a number and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

## 🧠 How It Works

* The computer generates a random number within a given range (default: 1 to 100).
* The player enters their guess.
* The program provides hints like:

  * “Too high”
  * “Too low”
* The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.

## 🚀 Features

* Interactive and beginner-friendly
* Random number generation
* Input validation
* Customizable number range
* Limited guess attempts (optional)

## 💻 Requirements

* Python 3.x
